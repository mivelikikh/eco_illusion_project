    "\n",
    "Initially, this dataset was used for a global competetion. In this competition, participants should develop accurate models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assessing the value of energy efficiency improvements can be challenging as there's no way to truly know how much energy a building would have used without the improvements. The best participants can do is to build counterfactual models. Once a building is overhauled the new (lower) energy consumption is compared against modeled values for the original building to calculate the savings from the retrofit. More accurate models could support better market incentives and enable lower cost financing.\n",
